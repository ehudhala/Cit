* look over all code (probably from commit onwards) and see if I forgot const functions.
* Stop using boost::optional for exceptions. use boost::expect.
* checkout should handle also branch.
* index should just be a tree object.
* ASSERT_OPTIONAL_EQ instead of assert + expect
* split store into 2-4 different files.
* Create a proper README and post to HN :)
